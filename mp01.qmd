## Task 4

The following questions address Task 4. Please click on the "Show Code" for an detailed approach on how I obtained my results.

<br>

1. How many different countries does Netflix operate in? (You can use the viewing history as a proxy for countries in which Netflix operates.)

```{r}
#| output: false
n_distinct(COUNTRY_TOP_10$country_name)
``` 
**Answer:** Netflix operates in ```r n_distinct(COUNTRY_TOP_10$country_name)``` different countries based on the viewing history data.

<br>

2. Which non-English-language film has spent the most cumulative weeks in the global top 10? How many weeks did it spend?

```{r}
Q2_RESULT <- GLOBAL_TOP_10 %>%
filter(category == "Films (Non-English)") %>%
group_by(show_title) %>%
summarise(`Maximum Cumulative Weeks` = max(cumulative_weeks_in_top_10, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
arrange(desc(`Maximum Cumulative Weeks`)) %>%
slice(1)

film_name_2 <- Q2_RESULT$show_title
weeks_count_2 <- Q2_RESULT[[2]]

Q2_RESULT %>%
format_titles() %>%
datatable(options = list(searching = FALSE, info = FALSE, paging = FALSE, columnDefs = list(list(className = 'dt-left', targets = "_all"))))

```

<br>

**Answer:** The non-English-language film `r film_name_2` spent the most cumulative weeks in the Global Top 10, with `r weeks_count_2` weeks.

<br>

3.	What is the longest film (English or non-English) to have ever appeared in the Netflix global Top 10? How long is it in minutes?
```{r}
Q3_RESULT <- GLOBAL_TOP_10 %>%
  filter(category %in% c("Films (Non-English)", "Films (English)")) %>%
  filter(!is.na(runtime)) %>%   
  group_by(show_title) %>%
  summarise(max_runtime = max(runtime)) %>%   
  arrange(desc(max_runtime)) %>%
  slice(1) %>%
  mutate(max_runtime_minutes = round(60 * max_runtime))

film_name_3 <- Q3_RESULT$show_title
run_time_3 <- Q3_RESULT[[3]]

Q3_RESULT %>%
select(-max_runtime) %>%
format_titles() %>%
datatable(options = list(searching = FALSE, info = FALSE, paging = FALSE, columnDefs = list(list(className = 'dt-left', targets = "_all"))))

```

<br>

**Answer:** The longest English or non-English film to have ever topped in the Netflix Global Top 10 is `r film_name_3`, with a length of `r run_time_3` minutes.

<br>

4. For each of the four categories, what program has the most total hours of global viewership?

```{r}
Q4_RESULT <- GLOBAL_TOP_10 %>%
group_by(category, show_title) %>%
summarise(total_hours_global_viewership = sum(weekly_hours_viewed, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop") %>%
group_by(category) %>%
slice_max(total_hours_global_viewership, n = 1) %>%
arrange(desc(total_hours_global_viewership)) %>%
mutate(total_hours_global_viewership = comma(total_hours_global_viewership))

Q4_RESULT %>%
format_titles() %>%
datatable(options = list(searching = FALSE, info = FALSE, paging = FALSE, columnDefs = list(list(className = 'dt-left', targets = "_all"))))
```

<br>

**Answer:** The above table highlights calculations that sum all seasons together (i.e.,franchise-level data). In other words, Stranger Things and Squid Game reflect the combined global viewership across all of their respective seasons.

<br>

5.	Which TV show had the longest run in a country’s Top 10? How long was this run and in what country did it occur?

```{r}

Q5_RESULT <- COUNTRY_TOP_10 %>%
filter(category == "TV") %>%
filter(!is.na(season_title)) %>%
group_by(country_name, show_title) %>%
summarise(max_cumulative_weeks = max(cumulative_weeks_in_top_10), .groups = "drop") %>%
arrange(desc(max_cumulative_weeks)) %>%
slice(1)

Q5_RESULT %>%
format_titles() %>%
datatable(options = list(searching = FALSE, info = FALSE, paging = FALSE, columnDefs = list(list(className = 'dt-left', targets = "_all"))))
```

<br>

**Answer:** Money Heist had the longest run in Pakistan, with 127 weeks in Netflix's Country Top 10 list. 

<br>

6. Netflix provides over 200 weeks of service history for all but one country in our data set. Which country is this and when did Netflix cease operations in that country?

```{r}

Q6_RESULT <- COUNTRY_TOP_10 %>%
group_by(country_name) %>%
summarise(total_weeks_of_data = n_distinct(week),final_week = max(week, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
filter(total_weeks_of_data < 200) %>%
arrange(total_weeks_of_data)

Q6_RESULT %>%
format_titles() %>%
datatable(options = list(searching = FALSE, info = FALSE, paging = FALSE, columnDefs = list(list(className = 'dt-left', targets = "_all"))))

```

<br>

**Answer:** Netflix could not provide over 200 weeks of service for Russia, as it ceased operations during the week of February 27, 2022, resulting in 35 weeks of data in the Country Top 10 list.

<br>

7. What is the total viewership of the TV show Squid Game? Note that there are three seasons total and we are looking for the total number of hours watched across all seasons.

```{r}
Q7_RESULT_SEASONS <- GLOBAL_TOP_10 %>%
filter(show_title == "Squid Game") %>%
filter(!is.na(season_title)) %>%
group_by(season_title) %>%
summarise(sum_hours = sum(weekly_hours_viewed, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
mutate(hours_watched = comma(sum_hours))

Q7_RESULT_SEASONS_SUM <- Q7_RESULT_SEASONS %>%
summarise(
season_title = "Total Hours Watched Across All Seasons",
sum_hours_1 = sum(sum_hours),
hours_watched = comma(sum_hours_1))

Q7_RESULT_FINAL <- bind_rows(Q7_RESULT_SEASONS, Q7_RESULT_SEASONS_SUM) %>%
select(season_title, hours_watched)

Q7_RESULT_FINAL %>%
format_titles() %>%
datatable(options = list(searching = FALSE, info = FALSE, paging = FALSE, columnDefs = list(list(className = 'dt-left', targets = "_all"))))
```

<br>

**Answer:** Across all three seasons, Squid Game had a total of 5,048,300,000 hours of global viewership. 

<br>

8. The movie Red Notice has a runtime of 1 hour and 58 minutes. Approximately how many views did it receive in 2021?

```{r}
Q8_ROWS <- GLOBAL_TOP_10 %>%
  mutate(week = as.Date(week)) %>%
  filter(show_title == "Red Notice", year(week) == 2021)

if (nrow(Q8_ROWS) == 0) {
  Q8_RESULT <- tibble(
    `Total Hours Viewed (2021)` = "N/A",
    `Approximate Views` = "N/A"
  )
} else {
Q8_RESULT <- Q8_ROWS %>%
summarise(
total_hours_2021 = sum(weekly_hours_viewed, na.rm = TRUE),
runtime_hours = 1 + 58/60,  # 1h 58m
approximate_views = total_hours_2021 / runtime_hours) %>%
mutate(`Total Hours Viewed (2021)` = comma(total_hours_2021), `Approximate Views` = comma(round(approximate_views))) %>%
select(`Total Hours Viewed (2021)`, `Approximate Views`)
}

Q8_RESULT %>%
datatable(options = list( searching = FALSE, info = FALSE, paging = FALSE,
columnDefs = list(list(className = 'dt-left', targets = "_all"))))

```

<br>

**Answer:** Based on the total number of hours viewed in 2021, Red Notice has approximately, 201,732,203 global views.

<br>

9. Part A: How many Films reached Number 1 in the US but did not originally debut there? 


```{r}

COUNTRY_TOP_10_US_ONLY <- COUNTRY_TOP_10 %>%
  filter(country_iso2 == "US", category == "Films") %>%
  mutate(week = as.Date(week))

US_FILMS_REACH1 <- COUNTRY_TOP_10_US_ONLY %>%
  group_by(show_title) %>%
  summarise(best_rank = min(weekly_rank, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop") %>%
  filter(best_rank == 1)

US_DEBUT <- COUNTRY_TOP_10_US_ONLY %>%
  group_by(show_title) %>%
  arrange(week, .by_group = TRUE) %>%    
  slice(1L) %>%                         
  ungroup() %>%
  transmute(show_title, debut_week = week, debut_rank = weekly_rank)

Q9_RESULT_PT1 <- US_FILMS_REACH1 %>%
  inner_join(US_DEBUT, by = "show_title") %>%
  filter(debut_rank > 1) %>%
  summarise(number_of_films = n())

```

<br>

**Answer:** A total of ```r Q9_RESULT_PT1``` films in the US reached to Number 1 after debuting at a lower ranking. 

<br>

9. Part B: What is the most recent film to pull this off?

```{r}

Q9_RESULT_PT2 <- COUNTRY_TOP_10 %>%
filter(country_iso2 == "US", category == "Films") %>%
mutate(week = as.Date(week)) %>%
group_by(show_title) %>%

Q9_RESULT_PT2 %>%
datatable(
  options = list(searching = FALSE, info = FALSE, paging = FALSE, columnDefs = list(list(className = 'dt-left', targets = "_all"))))

```

<br>

**Answer:** The most recent film to accomplish this was KPop Demon Hunters, which reached Number 1 during the week of September 14, 2025.

## Task 5: 
## Press Release 1: Nine Years Later: 93 Countries Await Stranger Things' Epic Finale


Netflix will release the fifth and final season of Stranger Things in late November 2025, concluding a global phenomenon that has generated nearly 3 billion viewing hours across 93 countries since its 2016 debut.

Across four seasons, Stranger Things has accumulated 2.97 billion global viewing hours, reaching an estimated 2.49 billion viewers worldwide. The series has spent an average of 13.4 weeks in Netflix’s Country Top 10 charts, with Pakistan and Ukraine leading at 24 weeks each, demonstrating sustained engagement well beyond initial release windows.

Season 4 delivered an unprecedented performance, accounting for 1.89 billion viewing hours, which represents 64% of the series' total. The season maintained a 19-week presence in Netflix's Global Top 10, including seven consecutive weeks at #1, cementing Stranger Things as Netflix's most-watched English-language genre series by total hours viewed.

Among Netflix's English-language sci-fi, fantasy, and supernatural genre originals, Stranger Things leads in cumulative viewing hours. Wednesday (2.84 billion hours across 2 seasons) demonstrates strong per-season averages, while The Witcher (1.12 billion hours, 3 seasons) and The Sandman (571 million hours, 2 seasons) round out the genre's top performers. Stranger Things maintains its position as the platform's premier franchise in the genre by total global hours.

Season 5 is poised to be one of 2025's most anticipated series finales, with a global fan base that has invested nine years in waiting to see how Eleven and the Upside Down’s story concludes.

## Task 6: Press Release 2
## Hindi Hits Go Global: 2 Million Netflix Subscribers, 463 Million Viewing Hours

Netflix is demonstrating growing global demand for its Hindi-language programming, with a portfolio of titles generating over 463 million hours of streamed content worldwide. These programs have established Netflix as a premier destination for Hindi entertainment, catering to audiences across India and beyond.

Standout titles such as Heeramandi: The Diamond Bazaar, Animal, and The Great Indian Kapil Show have collectively drawn substantial views from global audiences, highlighting their success on global Top 10 weekly charts. Among its broader catalog, Netflix offers 363 India-focused titles that did not appear in the US market yet achieved global Top 10 status. These titles represent nearly 50% of India's unique content offerings, demonstrating the international appeal of region-specific programming.

Based on viewing patterns and global engagement data, Netflix estimates approximately 2 million subscribers actively engage with Hindi content, representing India's significant presence in Hindi programming consumption. This figure encompasses viewers who regularly consume top-performing Hindi titles that have achieved worldwide recognition.

Beyond India, the broader South Asian streaming market exhibits dynamic growth patterns since 2021, with Pakistan leading regional expansion at 10.3% year-over-year growth in unique Top 10 programming. While Bangladesh and Sri Lanka exhibit positive trends, India has maintained steady engagement, achieving 1.5% growth. Collectively, these four markets offer over 1,400 programs, indicating a well-established, regional presence.

Given the global appeal of South Asian content, Netflix is well-positioned to expand its cross-border offerings through Urdu-language programming, leveraging the language's widespread use across India and Pakistan. This strategic approach aims to serve Urdu-speaking viewers across the region while fostering opportunities for cultural inclusion through shared storytelling.

Netflix's established presence across South Asia, including its strong performance in Hindi content and expanding regional offerings, positions the platform to seize the momentum in streaming growth while continuing to engage its global audiences with rich, South Asian storytelling.

## Task 7: Press Release 3 
## Billion-Hour Nostalgia: Telenovelas Dominate Netflix

<br>

Four classic telenovelas have collectively generated 1.2 billion global viewing hours on Netflix, demonstrating the enduring power of Spanish-language storytelling across Latin America and beyond.

Café con Aroma de Mujer, which debuted in 1994, leads with 813 million viewing hours, while Yo soy Betty, La Fea (1999) has amassed 297 million hours. Released in 2012, Pablo Escobar, el Patrón del Mal demonstrates exceptional longevity, maintaining 102 cumulative weeks in the top 10 across Colombia, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, highlighting the cross-border appeal of Spanish-language content. These telenovelas demonstrate how archival content continues to captivate new audiences in the streaming era, appealing to viewers' nostalgia while introducing these stories to younger generations.

Netflix's content portfolio strikes a balance between classic content and original programming. Elite, a Netflix Original series launched in 2018, has generated 568 million hours across eight seasons, reaching all 17 Latin American markets, a feat also accomplished by Pablo Escobar. Through this dual content strategy, subscribers have options that cater to their preferences, with Netflix leveraging proven classics while developing contemporary series.

With 670 million Spanish speakers across Latin America, Netflix's combination of archival and original content positions the platform to serve diverse generational tastes while expanding its regional subscriber base.
