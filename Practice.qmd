## Your Solution Strategy Summary

| Challenge | Your Solution | Implementation |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| **Time lag** | Use lag to your advantage - ensures clean pre/post separation | Pre: 2015-2019 ACS; Post: 2019-2023 ACS |
| **Overlapping years** | Standard practice; conservative approach | Frame as methodological strength |
| **Margins of error** | CDs large enough for reliable estimates | Report MOEs; flag unreliable estimates if needed |
| **Need current data** | 2019-2023 ACS published Dec 2024 | Available now; use 2018-2022 if needed sooner |

# PART 2: Updated Specific Questions

## Overarching Question:
**"Did COVID-19 reshape the drivers of housing affordability differently across NYC neighborhoods, revealing distinct local market dynamics?"**

---

## Refined Specific Questions (Final Version)

### **1. Transportation Accessibility (Tiffany)**

**"Did the relationship between transit accessibility and property values weaken post-COVID (2020-2025) compared to pre-COVID (2015-2019) across NYC's Community Districts, and did this weakening vary spatially?"**

**Operationalization:**
- **Unit of analysis**: 59 Community Districts
- **Transit accessibility**: Average distance to nearest 3 subway stations per CD
- **Property values**: Median sale price per CD from DOF Rolling Sales
- **Time periods**: Pre (2015-2019) vs. Post (2021-2025)
- **Test**: `Price ~ TransitDistance × PostCOVID × Borough + Controls`

**Expected finding**: Transit-price correlation weakened more in Manhattan/Downtown Brooklyn than outer boroughs

---

### **2. Crime and Safety (Kelly)**

**"How did crime's impact on housing costs change from pre-COVID (2015-2019) to post-COVID (2021-2025) across NYC's Community Districts, and did this shift vary by initial crime levels?"**

**Operationalization:**
- **Unit of analysis**: 59 Community Districts
- **Crime measure**: Major felony rate per 1,000 residents per CD (from NYPD data)
- **Property values**: Median sale price per CD
- **Test**: `Price ~ CrimeRate × PostCOVID × InitialCrimeLevel + Controls`

**Expected finding**: Crime became a stronger predictor of prices post-COVID, especially in previously low-crime areas

---

### **3. Educational Attainment (Eduardo)**

**"Did the strength of the relationship between neighborhood educational attainment and median home prices change post-COVID, and did this change differ across NYC's Community Districts?"**

**Operationalization:**
- **Unit of analysis**: 59 Community Districts  
- **Education measure**: % Bachelor's degree or higher from ACS
  - Pre-COVID: 2015-2019 ACS
  - Post-COVID: 2019-2023 ACS (or 2018-2022 ACS)
- **Property values**: Median sale price per CD
- **Test**: `Price ~ EducationLevel × PostCOVID × Borough + Controls`

**Expected finding**: Education premium weakened in Manhattan but strengthened or stayed stable in outer boroughs

---

### **4. Commercial Corridor Vitality (Madison)**

**"How did the relationship between commercial corridor vitality and nearby residential property values shift post-COVID across NYC's Community Districts?"**

**Operationalization:**
- **Unit of analysis**: 59 Community Districts
- **Commercial vitality**: 
  - Active businesses per square mile (from Business Licenses)
  - OR commercial property density from PLUTO
- **Property values**: Median residential sale price per CD
- **Test**: `ResidentialPrice ~ CommercialDensity × PostCOVID × Borough + Controls`

**Expected finding**: Commercial vitality became less important for residential values in Manhattan, more important in outer boroughs

---

### **5. Residential Density (Jonathan)**

**"Did high residential density become a penalty for property values post-COVID across NYC's Community Districts, and did this 'density penalty' vary by baseline density level?"**

**Operationalization:**
- **Unit of analysis**: 59 Community Districts
- **Density measure**: Residential units per acre from PLUTO
- **Property values**: Median sale price per CD
- **Test**: `Price ~ Density × PostCOVID × InitialDensityLevel + Controls`

**Expected finding**: Density penalty emerged in highest-density CDs (Manhattan core) but not in moderate-density areas

---

## How These SQs Answer the OQ

**The OQ asks**: Did COVID reshape **drivers** differently across **neighborhoods**, revealing **distinct markets**?

**Each SQ tests one driver:**

| SQ | Driver Tested | Spatial Variation Expected? | Market Fragmentation Evidence |
|----|---------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|
| 1 | Transit access | YES (weakened in core, stable elsewhere) | CBD-periphery decoupling |
| 2 | Public safety | YES (more important post-COVID, varies by baseline) | Safety-seeking segmentation |
| 3 | Education quality | YES (matters differently by borough) | Family-priority segmentation |
| 4 | Commercial amenities | YES (less important in Manhattan) | Amenity preference shifts |
| 5 | Density | YES (penalty in core, neutral elsewhere) | Density preference restructuring |

**Integration logic:**
- If **0-1** relationships changed differently → Weak fragmentation
- If **2-3** relationships changed differently → Moderate fragmentation (your likely finding)
- If **4-5** relationships changed differently → Strong fragmentation
- **Pattern** of which changed where reveals nature of new market structure

# PART 3: Geographic Scale Decision Slide

Here's content for your presentation slide:

---

## SLIDE CONTENT: "Geographic Scale: From Boroughs to Neighborhoods"

### **Title Slide:**
```
Refining Our Analytical Approach:
Why We Analyze Community Districts, Not Boroughs
```

### **Visual Layout:**

**[Left Side - Problem]**

**Initial Proposal: Borough-Level Analysis**
- 5 Boroughs = 5 Observations ❌
- Insufficient statistical power
- Cannot detect meaningful patterns
- Masks within-borough variation

[Visual: Simple map showing 5 boroughs in solid colors]

**[Right Side - Solution]**

**Refined Approach: Community District Analysis**
- 59 Community Districts = 59 Observations ✅
- 10x increase in statistical power
- Captures neighborhood-level variation
- Enables robust spatial analysis

[Visual: Map showing 59 CDs in varied colors]

---

### **Middle Section - Justification:**

**Why Community Districts?**

| Criterion | Boroughs ❌ | Community Districts ✅ |
|-----------|-------------|----------------------|
| **Sample Size** | n = 5 | n = 59 |
| **Statistical Power** | Inadequate for regression | Sufficient for interaction models |
| **Spatial Granularity** | Too coarse | Captures neighborhood variation |
| **Policy Relevance** | Limited actionability | City planning uses CDs |
| **Data Availability** | All sources available | Most sources aggregate to CD |

---

### **Bottom Section - Methods Note:**

**Analytical Implications:**

✅ **Enables difference-in-differences approach** (instructor's suggestion)
- Compare similar CDs that experienced different changes

✅ **Tests spatial heterogeneity rigorously**
- Can statistically test if relationships vary across space

✅ **Sub-borough granularity without excessive complexity**
- More than census tracts (2,100) but meaningful units

✅ **Aligns with instructor feedback**
> "Try to go sub-borough. If you work on a borough-level basis, you really only have 5 observations, which isn't much..."

### **Alternative Slide Version (More Visual):**

**[Top Half]**

**The Problem with Borough-Level Analysis**

[Graphic showing]:
```
Borough Analysis: n = 5

Regression with 5 observations:
- Cannot control for confounders
- Cannot detect interaction effects  
- Results not statistically reliable
- Masks neighborhood differences

Example: Manhattan
- Upper East Side ≠ Washington Heights
- But borough-level treats them the same
```

**[Bottom Half]**

**Our Solution: Community District Analysis**

[Graphic showing]:
```
Community District Analysis: n = 59

Enables robust statistical analysis:
✓ Proper regression with controls
✓ Interaction models (Factor × COVID × Space)
✓ Captures within-borough variation
✓ Sufficient power to detect effects

Example: Manhattan's 12 CDs
- Upper East Side (CD 8): High income, transit-rich
- Washington Heights (CD 12): Working class, transit-dependent
- Can now compare their different COVID responses
